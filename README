# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sangeetha!

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! I'm an enthusiastic tech explorer with a passion for Machine Learning, Data Science, and hardware-based projects. I enjoy working on real-world problems and turning ideas into working applications using technologies like Python, Raspberry Pi, AWS SageMaker, and more.

## 🔧 Projects I've Worked On

### 💡 Machine Learning Projects
- **Heart Disease Prediction**  
  A model to predict the presence of heart disease using anonymized health data with feature engineering and classification techniques.

- **Wine Quality Prediction (SageMaker + XGBoost)**  
  Built a regression model using Amazon SageMaker's hyperparameter tuning with the UCI Wine Quality dataset.

- **Iris Flower Classification**  
  Used Random Forest Classifier to categorize iris species — a great beginner ML classification project.

### 🔐 Security Projects
- **SVM-based Network Intrusion Detection**  
  Applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect anomalies and provide security to networks.

- **Spam Classification (with John)**  
  Collaborated with an Anti-Spam Researcher to classify spam using XGBoost in Java.

### 🔬 IoT/Hardware Projects
- **Automatic Plant Watering System (Raspberry Pi)**  
  Designed a smart watering system that senses soil moisture and waters plants automatically.

- **Gas Leakage Detection System**  
  Built a safety alert system using gas sensors and microcontrollers to detect and notify in case of gas leaks.
